If it's checked, undim coinjection and plasmids. also, for the search, if there is an extra-choromsomal transgene, then dipslay its coinjection markers and plasmidsif it's integrated, the items are disabled. so we have another state if extra-choromsomal transgene selector has no selected item one idea have an N/A item for selectize or a button, I don't have an extra-chromosomal itemfirst question how can I have N/A item in transgene. Extra-chromosomal is unknown item.1) lab-produced and integrated enable checkbox: is extra-chromsomal is not knownfor all other instances, button is hidden2) selecting it causes coinjection marker and plasmids to enable 3) deselect it causes them to re disableepvEx302 with coinjection 17 and plasmids 999 and 98 in wpc-111strain epo454 has transgene kurIs38 which in turn has epvEx302 as an external transgene; log doesn't record thisF-003, E1-3; N-001, H4jThe specified value does not conform to the required format, "yyyy-MM-dd".we need a list of every frozen entry in the database we figure out the last entry, then looop through buildFrozenList buildNitrogenList$theMaxFrozenNumber = $theMaxFrozenLetters = $this->returnCurrentFreezerNitrogenNumbers($theMaxFrozenNumber,$ theMaxFrozenLetters, $theMaxNitrogenNumber, $ theMaxNitrogenLetters);$theMaxFullFreezerNumber = "F-" . sprintf("%03d", $ theMaxFrozenNumber) .
