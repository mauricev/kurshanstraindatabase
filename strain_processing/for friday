for friday

we need to move this display to show only when a non-editor is in the database and we should have a user to ensure it shows up that way and still works

then we have a 
"table of strains handed off to you for further processing"

if the strain has been handed off and has not been moved to its final destination

moved to its final destination
there needs to be a boolean for this option in the database and we need to add that to the class and constructor

date frozen is no longer a date field in the edit strain dialog; it will now be a checkbox

survival checked

we have a new table for editors

strain name 	set status as frozen 						survival check									move to final destination
				will be a checkbox 							will be a checkbox 							will be a button
				and will have a confirmation prompt			and will have a confirmation prompt			and will have a confirmation prompt
				does essentially what handoff does			does essentially what handoff does			does essentially what handoff does
				but can be unchecked 						can be unchecked						but no date associated with this
				and will set date back to null				and will set date back to null				


disable/enable rules

if frozen is unhchecked, survival and move to are disabled
if survival is unchecked move to is disabled

when they change values, the disabling/enabling needs to update

the question is how we handle the enabling/disabling of buttons

how do we even handle the display of the button status?

the way to do this is to feed the button id of survival and move to the first button

when the first button is clicked and does its thing, it alters the button status of the other buttons

the same will apply to the survival check button

the edit screen will need the same buttons but here they won't need confirmation dialogs but they will need disabling/enabling code

Peri question?
does moved to final destination also get a date?
