add a new field under frozen and survived
date field
when null nothing is displayed
when set, date displays
it will have the same id as the button prepended with date-
so we can deduce its id from thebuttonid
we will populate it in html on at the outset
and then when we set the checkbox, we also set the date field; we have to read the date because it may not be today

is there an easy way to return two values via ajax?


frozen set, survive and move become enabled
frozen unset, survive and move are disabled

frozen is set, survive is available. if survive is set, frozen becomes disabled and move becomes available
if survive is not set, move is set to disabled

where do these button rules get set

we set the buttons initially in html

then we have a button update method that sets them whenever frozen and survival are updated

it then sets the buttons based on the rules above; it looks like there are four rules

start don't show moved strains
