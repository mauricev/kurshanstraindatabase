say we have a new construct
$theRestrictedTheWhereClause

1) there will be one for alleles and one for transgenes

2) it will have two options
2a) one for a single entry
2b) one for a mutliple entries

it also needs to append to the buddingqueryarray, but the question is at what point does it add these values and where does it get them from
it has to do this after where clause is built, but a problem 
if i am building alleles and I need to add to buddingqueryarray, i might add in the wrong order
the way this works for having array we build up the havingcountarray and then it's transferred to budding query array 

buildNotInClause() will use theRestrictedTheWhereClause, one for alleles and one for transgenes
will build differently for a single allele entry versus multiple allele entries
same applies to a single transgene entry versus multiple transgene entries

for alleles we have

if (!isset($_POST['alleleName_onlybox_htmlName']) {
	if ($theArrayCount > 1) {
		$theRestrictedWhereClause = $theRestrictedWhereClause . "AND truestrain_table.strain_id NOT IN (SELECT strain_fk FROM strain_to_allele_table WHERE allele_fk != ?"
	} else {
	// must loop and build up the ? marks
		$theRestrictedWhereClause = $theRestrictedWhereClause . "AND truestrain_table.strain_id NOT IN (SELECT strain_fk FROM strain_to_allele_table WHERE allele_fk NOT IN ("
	}
}
enter loop if needed and then append ?,? 

and end with )

could it go inside TransGenesSearchForStrains, the construct $this->searchParameter_prop contains the transgene reference
